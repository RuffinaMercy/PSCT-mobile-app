# PSCT Mobile Application

## About the Project
The **PSCT Mobile Application** is a mobile app developed using **Thunkable** for **Prajakirana Seva Charitable Trust**, an orphanage. This app was created as part of my service-learning project to support the organization by providing a digital platform for **community engagement, media sharing, and donations**.

## What is Thunkable?
**Thunkable** is a no-code platform that allows users to create mobile applications for **Android** and **iOS** without writing extensive code. It provides a drag-and-drop interface where users can add components, connect logic blocks, and integrate third-party services like APIs and databases. Thunkable is widely used by beginners and professionals to develop apps quickly and efficiently.

### How Thunkable Works
- Users build apps by **dragging and dropping components** onto the design canvas.
- Logic and functionality are implemented using **block-based programming** (similar to Scratch or MIT App Inventor).
- Apps can be **tested in real-time** using Thunkable Live.
- Integration with **Google Sheets, Cloudinary, Firebase, and APIs** allows for advanced functionalities like authentication and data storage.
- Once completed, apps can be **exported as APKs, published to the Play Store, or deployed on iOS**.

## Features & Functionality

### 1. Login & Authentication
- Users can log in using their username and password.
- **Admin Login**: Redirects to the Create Community Screen.
- **User Login**: Redirects to the Join Community Screen.
- **New User Registration**: A sign-up page allows users to create an account with all necessary details.
- User authentication and account creation details are managed via **Google Sheets API**.

### 2. PSCT Dashboard

### 3. Admin Privileges
- Only **Admins** can upload and remove media files from:
  - **Daily Events**
  - **Upcoming Events**
  - **Gallery**
- Users can only view the media but cannot add/remove them.

### 4. Media Management using Cloudinary & Google Sheets
- When an image is uploaded, it is stored in **Cloudinary**.
- The **Cloudinary-generated link** is stored in **Google Sheets** via API.
- Images are then retrieved from **Google Sheets** and displayed in the app.

### 5. Data Storage & Management
- **Google Sheets API** is used for storing user details and verifying login credentials.
- **Media file links** are stored and fetched dynamically using Google Sheets.
